# Sales-and-Operations-planning-Project
In this project, I am going to simulate a sales and operations planning using the zero-stock level strategy. So i wrote  a Python program that asks the user to enter the following data:
- An initial stock level for a product
- The number of month(s) to plan
- The planned sales quantity for each month
Based on this data, it will calculate the required production quantity as follows:
- If the sales quantity is smaller than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is 0
- If the sales quantity is larger than the stock level of the previous month, the production quantity is this difference
